# AlexaWatPark
[Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-And-Alexa-Devices/b?ie=UTF8&node=9818047011) is the personal intelligent assistant developed by Amazon. WatPark is an [Alexa Skill](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit) that gives you real-time update on parking status at the University of Waterloo.

## What has been done?
* You can ask for meter, permit, visitor, short term, accessible, and motorcycle parking information. WatPark will provide you with a list of lot names and lot descriptions.
* You can ask for the detailed information on a specific lot, like lot T. WatPark will provide you with detailed information on that specific lot.
* You can ask for current student parking condition. The parking condition is updated real-time, and WatPark will give you suggestions on where to park based on current parking conditions.
